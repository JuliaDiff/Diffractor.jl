Note that TⁿB is itself another manifold and thus in particular a vector space (over ℝ). As such, subtypes of this abstract type are expected to support the usual vector space operations.\n\nHowever, beyond that, this abstract type makes no guarantee about the representation. That said, to gain intution for what this object is, it makes sense to pick some explicit bases and write down examples.\n\nTo that end, suppose that B=ℝ. Then T¹B=T¹ℝ is just our usual notion of a dual number, i.e. for some element η ∈ T¹ℝ, we may consider η = a + bϵ for real numbers (a, b) and ϵ an infinitessimal differential such that ϵ^2 = 0.\n\nEquivalently, we may think of η as being identified with the vector (a, b) ∈ ℝ² with some additional structure. The same form essentially holds for general B, where we may write (as sets):\n\nT¹B = {(a, b) | a ∈ B, b ∈ Tₐ B }\n\nNote that these vectors are orthogonal to those in the underlying base space. For example, if B=ℝ², then we have:\n\nT¹ℝ² = {([aₓ, a_y], [bₓ, b_y]) | [aₓ, a_y] ∈ ℝ², [bₓ, b_y] ∈ Tₐ ℝ² }\n\nFor convenience, we will sometimes writes these in one as:\n\nη ∈ T ℝ²  = aₓ x̂ + a_y ŷ + bₓ ∂/∂x|_aₓ x + b_y ∂/∂y|_{a_y}\n         := aₓ x̂ + a_y ŷ + bₓ ∂/∂¹x + b_y ∂/∂¹y\n         := [aₓ, a_y] + [bₓ, b_y] ∂/∂¹\n         := a + b ∂/∂¹\n         := a + b ∂₁\n\nThese are all definitional equivalences and we will mostly work with the final form. An important thing to keep in mind though is that the subscript on ∂₁ does not refer to a dimension of the underlying base manifold (for which we will rarely pick an explicit basis here), but rather tags the basis of the tangent bundle.\n\nLet us iterate this construction to second order. We have:\n\nT²B = T¹(T¹B) = { (α, β) | α ∈ T¹B, β ∈ T_α T¹B }\n              = { ((a, b), (c, d)) | a ∈ B, b ∈ Tₐ B, c ∈ Tₐ B, d ∈ T²ₐ B}\n\n(where in the last equality we used the linearity of the tangent vector).\n\nFollowing our above notation, we will canonically write such an element as:\n\n  a + b ∂₁ + c ∂₂ + d ∂₂ ∂₁\n= a + b ∂₁ + c ∂₂ + d ∂₁ ∂₂\n\nIt is worth noting that there still only is one base point a of the underlying manifold and thus TⁿB is a vector bundle over B for all N.\n\nFurther Reading\n\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_bundle\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"api.html#Diffractor.CompositeBundle","page":"API","title":"Diffractor.CompositeBundle","text":"CompositeBundle{N, B, B <: Tuple}\n\nRepresents the tagent bundle where the base space is some tuple or struct type.

As always in the literature, some of these references use terms differently from how they are used in Diffractor (as well as being inconsistent with each other). Additionally, many of these references are quite dense and though I've found small nuggets of insight in each, excavating those took many hours. Also, these are not introductory texts.
